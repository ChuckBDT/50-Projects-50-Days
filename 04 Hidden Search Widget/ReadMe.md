# 04 Hidden Search Widget

## Notes

So this one was easy, with all the things i've learned from the early projects i tried (with success i guess) to entirely do it without looking at the video.

And surprisingly i did it in a shorter way again, i still don't know if that's better but it's working.

The difference is that the teacher is using positions (absolute & relative) to keep the btn in the middle while i simply use flexbox (justify-content) to center it all. I've also add some border-radius to make it prettier.
